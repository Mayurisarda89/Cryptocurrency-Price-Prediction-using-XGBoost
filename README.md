# Cryptocurrency-Price-Prediction-using-XGBoost
This repository contains code and resources for predicting the future price of Bitcoin using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm. 


# Introduction
Cryptocurrency price prediction is a challenging and important task in the financial industry. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques, specifically the XGBoost algorithm, to predict the future price of Bitcoin. The trained model achieves impressive performance with a MAE of 0.02658387822445798 and RMSE of 0.03641535799501778.

# Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:
Python 3.x
XGBoost
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn

# Data
The data used for training and evaluating the model should be in a specific format. Each data point should include relevant features and the corresponding target value (Bitcoin price).
files for data is attached.

# Evaluation
To evaluate the trained model, you can use various metrics such as MAE, RMSE, or R-squared. In this project, we achieved a MAE of 0.02658387822445798 and RMSE of 0.03641535799501778.
